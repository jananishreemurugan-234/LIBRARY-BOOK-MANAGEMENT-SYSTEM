# LIBRARY-BOOK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

## Project Overview

The Library Book Management System is a simple console-based Python project developed as part of the RISE Internship – Python Programming Projects.
Libraries in schools and colleges often face challenges with tracking books, student issue/return details, and calculating fines.
This beginner-friendly project provides a straightforward way to manage these operations using dictionaries, datetime module, loops, and conditionals.

It is designed as a menu-driven application where the librarian or user can easily add books, remove books, issue them to students, handle returns, and calculate fines for late submissions.

## Objectives

Build a practical system to manage library records.

Learn how to use Python dictionaries to store structured data.

Understand date handling with the datetime module.

Implement conditional logic to handle different operations.

Practice menu-driven programs for real-world use cases.

## Features

1. Add Books → Add new books with Book ID, Title, Author, and Quantity.


2. Remove Books → Remove books from the collection using Book ID.


3. Issue Book → Issue a book to a student, record the issue date, and calculate the due date (7 days by default).


4. Return Book → Accept book returns, check if they are late, and calculate fines (₹10 per day late).


5. Display Books → Show all available books with their details.


6. Exit → Safely close the program.


## Technologies Used

Python 3.13.6

Datetime Module → for due date and fine calculation

Dictionaries → for storing book and student records

Console Input/Output → for user interaction


## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Save the File

Save the code as library_management.py.

### Step 2: Run in Terminal

Open your terminal or command prompt, go to the folder where the file is saved, and run:

python library_management.py


## Learning Outcomes

Gained hands-on experience in building a real-world project.

Understood the use of dictionaries for structured data storage.

Learned how to use the datetime module for date arithmetic.

Improved knowledge of loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

Learned how to design a menu-driven console application.


## Future Enhancements

Add file storage (JSON/CSV) to keep data even after program exits.

Add search functionality to find books quickly.

Implement student ID system for better tracking.

Build a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt.


## Conclusion

The Library Book Management System is a complete beginner-level project that helps understand the fundamentals of Python programming.

It combines dictionaries, dates, and conditionals in a practical application.

This project is an excellent foundation for building more advanced Library Management Systems with databases or GUI in the future.
